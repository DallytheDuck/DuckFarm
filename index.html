            <p class="content">The best ducks in the country.<br/>Founded in 1879 by Mr. Adolph Fellonwark and Ms. Gwendlyn Fellonwark, these free rage ducks are fed on natural grass and corn in Scotland. The ducks are not fed or injected by any harmful or GM medicine, so it is perfectly safe to adopt one or eat one.</p>

            <p class="content">Our farm is on the north coast of Scotland, and through our farm runs a river and a pond. We have chosen this place since we wish to keep our ducks as natural as possible in a natural environment. The ducks can meet deer, bagders etc. but we make sure that they do not get harmed or eaten.</p>
